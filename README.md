# Hacker News Clone Part 2 
 
##Learning Competencies 

##Summary 

 Now we're going to add voting to our Hacker News clone. 

## Part 2: Bring on the Votes

What's Hacker News without voting.  Users should be able to up and down vote posts and comments. 

## Objectives

Users should be able to vote up both comments and posts.  For now, you can have two separate tables for each type of vote.

### Models &amp; Controllers

At the very least you should have the following models:

1. `Post`
2. `User`
3. `Comment`
3. `PostVote`
4. `CommentVote`

Don't try to do something fancy and have `PostVote` and `CommentVote` inherit from a shared base class.  Just have two separate tables and classes for now.

### Views

Implement all the views and use AJAX to implement the voting.
